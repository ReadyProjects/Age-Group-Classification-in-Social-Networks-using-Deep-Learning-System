Age Group Classification in Social Networks using Deep Learning System
Title  : Age-Group-Classification-in-Social-Networks-using-Deep-Learning-System
Abstract:

This paper presents a novel approach for age-group classification in social networks employing a deep learning system. The increasing ubiquity of social media platforms necessitates advanced methods for demographic analysis, with age being a crucial demographic factor. Our proposed system utilizes deep learning techniques, leveraging the power of neural networks to extract meaningful features from user profiles and content.

The methodology involves the construction of a robust dataset comprising diverse social network profiles annotated with accurate age labels. We employ state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, fine-tuning them for the specific task of age-group classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately predicting age groups across various social media platforms.

Furthermore, the paper explores the interpretability of the model's predictions, shedding light on the features contributing to age classification. The implications of age-group classification in social networks extend to personalized content delivery, targeted advertising, and social science research. The results indicate promising performance and underline the potential of deep learning for demographic analysis in the dynamic landscape of social media.

In conclusion, our deep learning-based age-group classification system contributes to the evolving field of social network analysis, providing a valuable tool for understanding and leveraging demographic information in the digital realm.
